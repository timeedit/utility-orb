  Utility orb containing commands and jobs that are shared between projects.
  Most parameters of string type have a default value which is "$VARIABLE".
  The convention is to set the variable value in a env step because all commands and jobs sources $BASH_ENV, making those variables available then we can use the variables default values. Those parameters of type env_var_name are expected to just have the variable name excluding the "$", meaning "$VARIABLE" is incorrect but "VARIABLE" is correct.
# What will your orb allow users to accomplish?
# Descriptions should be short, simple, and informative.

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
